### 2015-09 Start of GRBL-Plotter
After struggeling with an other GCode sender (just working when logged-in as admin) and missing features,
I started my own GCode sender. 
My main use is 2.5D usage for a CNC router and a plotter.  
The most disturbing points were:  
* no automatic reconnect, when starting the program
* no automatic set of the feed rate, when moving the stage the first time
* poor manual control (joystick) via user interface
